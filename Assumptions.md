# Assumptions

At the minimum to fulfill this request a database and backend server is needed. However, assuming this is going to be published and become a production API, there is several things that need to be considered.


* Backend server (with Authentication Layer)
* Database (with proper auth and secret managment)
* QA & Prod Deployment processes


# Questions for PM/ScrumMaster 
* Is this going to be a public API
* Expected Timeline (establish deadline)
* How many concurrent users are expected? (Helps identify hardware/cloud needs)
